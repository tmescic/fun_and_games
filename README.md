Fun and games
=============

Various programming challanges and other stuff that is fun.

1. Product of ints, implemented in GO ([link](https://github.com/tmescic/fun-and-games/tree/master/product_of_ints))
2. Knapsack problem, with cakes, implemented in Java ([link](https://github.com/tmescic/fun-and-games/tree/master/cakes))
3. Calculates the value of the Zeta function for various N (implemented in golang)
4. Finding a minimum distance in a binary matrix - from (0, 0) to destination node (Java)
5. Finding the shortest path from start node to all nodes in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm (Kotlin)
